# Deprecated Components

This directory contains legacy artifacts that are no longer part of the active Pete-Eebot package. The files are retained for historical reference only.

* `pete_e/` â€“ the previous FastAPI webhook implementation and the Tailscale-based Apple Health ingestion path.
* SQL migration drafts that have since been superseded by the scripts in `init-db/`.

Do not modify or reuse this code in new development unless you are intentionally reviving the legacy stack.
