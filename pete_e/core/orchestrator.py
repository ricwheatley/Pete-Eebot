"""
The central orchestrator for all Pete-E business logic.

This class is responsible for coordinating the various services (narratives,
progression, validation) to generate reports and manage the training cycle.
It is completely decoupled from the data storage mechanism, relying entirely on
the DataAccessLayer (DAL) that is injected during its initialization.
